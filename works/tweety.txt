*Where I take a twitter profile image, run it through some image processing algorithms to figure out which pixels should be filled, and map that twitter user's most recent tweets to each pixel.*

--Inspiration--
In early November 2015, I attended my first [wafflejs](https://wafflejs.com/) where [@kosamari](https://twitter.com/kosamari) was giving a talk about her knitting projects. She explained that she wanted to take the images she found online and use them as knitting patterns - but because knitting patterns only took two colors, and the images she found had many, she had to teach herself some image processing algorithms.

Her explanation of dithering algorithms consumed me until it was all I could think about:
TWITTER CARD

--Experimentation--
Mariko hadn't put any of her slides or code online after her talk, so I had to make do with what I could remember.  I took to experimenting on bl.ocks, where I took an image and turned it to grayscale, and then applied various different dithering algorithms until I came out with one I was satisfied with:
IMAGES

I then mapped each filled pixel to my most recent set of tweets:

I sized
