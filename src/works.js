A twelve-month collaboration with the brilliant [Nadieh Bremer](https://twitter.com/NadiehBremer) of [Visual Cinnamon](http://www.visualcinnamon.com/).

Each month, we choose a topic and build a visualization by the end of the month; an opportunity to experiment and create.  In the process, we document the trials and successes we faced wrangling the data, sketching, and coding the visualization.

When I was a kid, I loved two things: math and art. I wanted to be a painter or Pixar animator when I grew up.  When I entered high school, I took an exhaustive number of math and science classes.  By the end of the four years, I wanted absolutely nothing to do with them.

So naturally, my eighteen-year-old self decided that business would be the exact opposite and be my raison d'Ãªtre.  Fast-forward three years to my junior year, and I realized I abhored my business classes and adored the few Computer Science classes I took.  When I completed my summer internship at an investment bank, I knew that I couldn't go back.  I decided that I would focus my senior year on completing a CS minor and looking for a full-time job in software engineering.

(My friends told me they had expected this of me all along: "why did you even go into business, anyway?")

And somehow, miraculously, I landed a full-time position at [Splunk](https://www.splunk.com/) post-graduation.  (I was beside myself with relief and joy.)  I was introduced to D3 as part of my job, and slowly fell in love with its genius.  I adored [D3](https://d3js.org/) and the broader field of data visualization; they felt like a beautiful combination of art and code.

When I started at [Illumio](https://www.illumio.com/home), I was happy with my technical knowledge, but wanted to apply it and build a long-term project from the ground up.  [Illumination](https://www.illumio.com/services#illumination) allowed me to do that; I learned so much about teamwork, and the joys and pitfalls of building out a piece of the product from its inception.

I left Illumio in the summer of last year, and have been trying my hand at freelancing since.  It's been an amazing (though stressful) ride, and I've had the opportunity to work with companies in a wide variety of industries.  It's been eye-opening to learn about their products, their problem statements, and their philosophies.  I've also had the opportunity to step away from product, and try my hand at narrative and storytelling.

I'm hoping to keep freelancing for as long as I can.  I'm still excited to see where I go from here.
